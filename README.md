# TranslatorBotJava
This is telegram bot. It can translate sentences and texts. I'm using python with it for translate because it's free

Hey!
This is my telegram bot, it is made in Java. But I'm using JSON code that I get from my site, made in Python. I used Python because there are free libraries out there with different translator APIs. I used this library https://pypi.org/project/translate-api/
